## Unlock performance gains with XGBoost, Amazon SageMaker Neo, and Serverless Artillery

This repository contains code for setting up a framework to test performances of various Amazon SageMaker endpoint configurations. A walkthrough of the framework and how to set it up can be found by following along in the `NeoBlog.ipynb` notebook. In particular, the notebook shows how SageMaker Neo unlocks near 3x performance gains for our own XGBoost model artifact.
